This project is a mock build/prototype of YourSocialOffers.com. A project designed by Pennexx Foods, constructed by me.
This project, in essence, is a coupon/discount redemption app. It is not connected to any back-end sources, your personal, or any, information will not be sent anywhere.
Once connected, users would either sign up, or sign in if already existing, search through, pick, add, and share with friends. Alongside these perks, information, ideas, and ownership can be found by navigating through the site.
